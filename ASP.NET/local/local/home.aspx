                The customer journey often begins with an online or mobile search and ends at a local business' storefront. According to a recent Google study.Local mobile searchers visit a store within a day of their search, and those visits result in a purchase. With a strong digital presence, local businesses can not only increase their online visibility, but can also drive more consumers to their physical locations.

The best way to improve a local business' digital presence is to claim, correct, and enhance online business listings. Incorrect or outdated listings disproportionately hurt how a local business shows up on a search results page. Inaccurate and incorrect listings also provide a poor user search experience and can cause irreparable damage to a business' reputation, travels to that location, and then finds out that the business is closed when they said they would be open that local shop just lost a potential customer due to poor and mismanaged facts about the business.
            These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection..
